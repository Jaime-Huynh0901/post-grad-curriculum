# Post Grad Curriculum
A curriculum for additional learning for those graduating from the university-based coding programs. End goal is to help students go from being junior devs -> Mid-level Devs -> Senior Devs

## Contributors
- Please fork the repo and make a pull request when submitting your code. That's it!
- Project management is done via Zenhub board, with tracking being done via Github issues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recipients
- Please note that this is entirely built on the efforts of developers voluntarily putting their own time in. We hope you enjoy our efforts!
- That said, we are very receptive to feedback! Please submit issues if there are any problems or improvements to be made. 

## Where do I start?

  - Before we start determining what step you should work on next, here are some bits of advice that are universal after graduating: 

	1. MOST IMPORTANTLY: **NEVER STOP CODING**
	2. Always have a side project - This can always count towards your coding experience, even if you are working another job.
	3. Practice small coding challenges - This is a good practice you can do daily and will keep your skills fresh.
	4. Programming is like a foreign language, if you don’t use it and practice it normally, it will be harder to get back into it.
   
  - To help you get comfortable with doing the above you can start with the other parts below.

### Part 1: If you haven’t completed career assets, finish those first

  1. Linkedin: https://cstrilogy.gitbooks.io/career-services-resource-library/polish-your-linkedin-profile.html 
  2. Github: https://cstrilogy.gitbooks.io/career-services-resource-library/polishing-your-portfolio-github-and-linkedin-accounts/github-criteria.html
  3. Additionally, your readme can follow the following guidelines: https://www.makeareadme.com/ 
  4. We would also recommend having a gif of your application running placed into the readme for employers to see what your application does fairly easily. 
  5. Resume: https://cstrilogy.gitbooks.io/career-services-resource-library/ft-web-dev-materials.html 
  6. Portfolio: https://cstrilogy.gitbooks.io/career-services-resource-library/polishing-your-portfolio-github-and-linkedin-accounts.html 

Note: Time should first be spent on finishing career assets before applying to jobs.

### Part 2: If you have completed career assets, but feel you don’t have a base understanding of the material.

  1. Go through the material you feel behind on by checking the topics you still don’t grasp: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzZc9xnaQ0vqcWVEd3hPcHRhQTg/view?usp=sharing
  2. In order to get practice with the concepts you feel behind on, do the following:
  3. Redo in-class exercises without looking at the answers
  4. Complete the Code Drills from Jerome Chennete’s set of Code Drills: https://github.com/jeromechenette/coding-bootcamp-post-bootcamp#post-coding-boot-camp
     - This is very comprehensive and a lot of work was put into building out the code drills by Jerome Chennette, an Instructor at UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp.
  5. Apply to positions that are more in line with the concepts you do feel stronger in. For example, if you feel strong in front end development, apply to jobs in front end development.
  6. Practice for interviewing by completing algorithms on the whiteboard. Here is a resource we've developed for whiteboard and interview prep: gitbook.com/read/book/the-coding-bootcamp/pre-work-book?key=CodingRocksAJ16 (make sure to have the kay-value pair in the query params or it won't work!)
  7. Time breakdown:
     - Time spent on applying to jobs that you do feel comfortable with: 30%
     - Time spent on interview prep: 20%
     - Time spent on practicing code: 50%

### Part 3: If you feel at least OK with the fundamentals, but not sure what to do next
  <img width="400" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fhAwk4DnqNgw8/giphy.gif">

   1. If you feel that you have the fundamentals of the program down, it's now time to start learning more advanced topics and adding those concepts to the applications you build.
      1. Start at "Level 1" if you don't have a specific topic in mind that you want to take a deep dive into. We structured this curriculum to leave off where the previous curriculum ended, so we prefer taking the same step-by-step approach for learning. However, if you wanted to learn other topics, go ahead! The structure is there for those who want it, but you can hop around different topics if you want to (for instance, if you already know certain topics or if your work has you working on a particular topic or set of topics).
	  -	Note that the "Levels" might not reflect the difficulty of the concepts, but rather the order of the curriculum. So, some concepts in "Level 9" might be easier to understand and implement than in "Level 3" and vice versa. 
	  - What is the roadmap? Ie, where am I going??
        - We'll generally be following this roadmap: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap, but making our own tweaks to it as we see fit. 
   1. Practice for interviewing by completing algorithms on the whiteboard. Here is a resource we've developed for whiteboard and interview prep: gitbook.com/read/book/the-coding-bootcamp/pre-work-book?key=CodingRocksAJ16 (make sure to have the kay-value pair in the query params or it won't work!)
   2. Time breakdown:
      - Time spent on applying to jobs that more or less match your skill level: 50%
      - Time spent on interview prep: 20%
      - Time spent on practicing code: 30%
