Prerequisites: You need to be able to program in at least 1 programming language

Estimated Time: 5 to 20+ hours

1. Big O notation - How we measure "efficiency"
2. Binary Search
3. Selection Sort
4. Recursion
5. Graph Algorithms
6. Much much more

##### Summary: 

Studying well known Algorithms give us efficent ways to solve a variety of problems in our toolbox. Many employers use them to "gauge" developer applicants to "sort" (pun intended) them out into two categories You either A: Know algorithms or B: You do not. Be in the first group with this guide!
