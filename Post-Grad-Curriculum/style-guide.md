# Hey, Listen! 

## This is the style guide for how each module should be written. Uniformity leads to ease of transition between each module. 

Each module should have the following: 
1. A link to the tutorial
2. Confirmation that the tutorial was implemented by you
3. What system the tutorial was implemented and tested on (OS, Browser version)
4. Summary/Overview of tutorial
5. Issues that you ran into while implementing the technology/concept
