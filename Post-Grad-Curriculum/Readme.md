# Post-Grad Curriculum

## So, you've decided to level up, eh? Good on you! We've developed some structure for you based on the paths you decide to take. 
- We're generally going to be using the roadmap from [Kamran](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). This is just going to be a guideline, so don't worry about needing to learn all of this in order to be a developer! The roadmap is just there to help guide us towards what technologies we can learn depending on your path.

### The curriculum is fairly simple, in terms of structure (but not content!):

- Each path will have different levels, taking you through the path based on relative complexity. For example, Level 1 material is relatively less complex than Level 2.
- Within each Level, you will find tutorials about the technology covered. You will be following along the tutorial and implementing the technology into either an existing application or into a new application.
